			<center><h5>Quick-Share ToS and Privacy Policy</h5></center>
			<hr>
			<p><i><ins>
				I have not yet implemented a proper webpage that goes into detail about this topic,
				which I will do soon. For now, this page serves as a placeholder. So for now,
				below is a general gist of how things work:
			</ins></i></p>
			<h5>Terms of service</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>
				You agree granted the right to use the quick-share feature solely for publicly sharing your
				statistics via my servers. By using the feature, the statistics you share become public to
				literally everyone with an internet connection (myself included).
			</p>
			<p>
				And of course, you agree not to abuse this feature or use it for any other purpose. Things like
				attempting to spread malicious files, spamming requests to the server (DDoS), and other stuff
				that common-sense would tell you are bad, are not allowed.<br>
				In addition, the servers utilize tools such as rate-limiters, and analysis of the traffic that goes
				thru, to prevent abuse. If my servers find that your traffic is abusive, rate-limits, or even bans,
				may take place.<br>
				TLDR; Please don't be a meanie. I don't want someone ruining it for everyone else.
			</p>

			<h5>Privacy policy</h5>
			<hr>
			<p><i>
				I will try to keep this section simple as well, so you don't have to deal with complicated jargon language.
			</i></p>
			<p>
				My servers rely on
				<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> and
				<a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a> to operate.
				This means that whenever you interact with my servers, you are doing so through them.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				I use Cloudflare for security reasons, to keep my servers safe from bad actors and malicious
				robots. And so far, they've helped out a lot, and even stopped a bunch of hacking attempts.
				To do this, I employ what's known as a "Web application firewall" (WAF). This firewall is
				the thing all of your traffic will go through.
				In addition, this firewall may log your traffic and information about your requests (yes,
				including IP addresses). However, please be not alarmed, as this is
				completely normal with pretty much most sites out there, including CurseForge and Modrinth,
				as they too use Cloudflare. I may also access these logs for analytical and
				security purposes (which of-course, helps me strengthen my defenses).
				<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for my website server, the one responsible for API calls the quick-share feature makes,
				it utilizes a database to enforce rate-limits and other measures to ensure abuse prevention
				and stuff like that. To do this, it needs to utilize a method to keep track of you, hence
				why I chose to use your IP address for that. However, given I care about security and privacy
				the most, I do not store your IP address in plain-text. Instead, your IP is hashed prior
				to being stored. This basically means it's "obscured", as in, "obfuscated".<br>
				For example, IP "1.1.1.1" may look something like "soipfghaew9-ighqe9pr-goeuigep9rgergf" in
				the database (yes, I mashed my keyboard to type that). That way, I can not see your personal
				info such as the IP address, while still allowing the server to enforce the rules it needs to enforce.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, your game client, aka, better statistics screen, may send additional info to the
				server, such as the game/mod version you are running on, and info about the player making the
				request. This is used not only for anti-abuse measures, but so the server can know how to respond
				(aka for things like backwards-compatibility and stuff like that). Note that as of BSS v3.12,
				this information is not stored anywhere, and is only processed.
			</p>

			<center><h6>And lastly, the most important part</h6></center>
			<p>
				I DO NOT disclose or share any of the PII my servers collect. This means stuff like IP addresses,
				info about HTTP requests to the servers, and so on, stay where they are, only for long
				enough for them to fulfill their purposes. And after some time passes, the collected
				info eventually gets erased.<br>
				For example, my rate-limiting logs may last for a few hours to a few days, whereas Cloudflare
				logs may remain for around a month.
			</p>
			<p>
				I care a lot about your security and privacy, and about security and privacy in general.
				I will therefore ensure that not only are the
				servers safe from bad actors, but that your information is safe as well.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<center><p><i>
				Please also read the
				<a href="https://thecsdev.com/legal/" target="_blank">TheCSDev.Com</a>'s
				Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, as they too apply (altho they mostly have similar terms).
				I plan on eventually moving this document over there, so it's easier to navigate.
