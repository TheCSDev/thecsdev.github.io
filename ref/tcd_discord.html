        <b>The Discord server has been closed</b>
        <p>Hello, and thank you for trying to visit the Discord server. After a lot of time had passed, I have decided to eventually shut down the server, as there was little no activity present there. Furthermore, most members that have joined have also left shortly afer (likely due to low member count), meaning, there was unfortunately little to no "interest or demand" for a Discord server existing at the moment. If you are here because you need help with anything, you may still reach out on GitHub by opening an issue. Thank you!</p>
